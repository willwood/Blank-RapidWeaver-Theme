# Blank RapidWeaver Theme

## Introduction
This is a third-party theme for [RapidWeaver](https://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/) on Mac OS. Blank is intended for either creating quick test pages, a foundation for building custom RapidWeaver themes, or as the perfect blank canvas for using your own stacks and markup to create a more complete page design. Blank has many possibilities. Arguably one of the most popular third-party themes ever released for RapidWeaver.

Blank comprises of a bare-minimum of HTML markup, like your `DOCTYPE`, `head`, `body` and a `main` content container. It purposefully foregoes anything extra like banners, logos, titles, slogans, navigation, sidebars or footers (these are components you would need to add yourself if you want them). 

The resulting codebase is extremely lightweight, resulting in super-fast loading webpages. And from a testing perspective the "no noise" approach makes Blank a perfect sandbox for debugging and troubleshooting addon issues.

## Using Blank
Within the theme style settings panel, there are some checkboxes to add commonly used CSS resets, icon collections and libraries as needed. These can be used to neutralise default web browser styling and load-in extra CSS styling as desired. For example, with Bootstrap enabled, you can use any components listed on the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) website.

The main page content container spans the full 100% width of the screen. To constrain its width, uncheck the **Full Page Width** checkbox and type a desired width (in pixels) in the number box.

Blank has no other style settings or any colour pickers. Using a combination of HTML markup, stacks or custom CSS code, theoretically you can build anything using Blank. It is a true "blank canvas" to build with.

## Installation
1. Download the latest Blank release from the GitHub repository.
2. Locate the downlaoded ZIP on your computer. Unzip the download file.

Remember to duplicate and rename the theme inside RapidWeaver, if you plan to make any hefty modifications you don't want undone by future updates!

## Compatibility 
Blank is compatible across all major web browsers and devices. This includes all newer web browsers built on WebKit, Mozilla and Chromium rendering engines. The addition of a viewport tag ensures automatic resizing of the page to fit mobile devices, without the user needing to manually pinch-to-zoom.

RapidWeaver compatibility includes both RapidWeaver 8 and RapidWeaver Classic. All common page types like [Stacks](https://yourhead.com/stacks) are supported.
